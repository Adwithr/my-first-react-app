      Shawarma's name comes from a Turkish word meaning "turning," referring to its rotating spit cooking method that originated in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, influencing dishes like
      Greek gyros and Mexican al pastor tacos. This Levantine street food features thin, marinated meat—like lamb, chicken, or beef—slow-roasted and shaved off a vertical spit, served in flatbreads
      with various garnishes like pickles, tahini, and fries, and it's a popular dish globally.
